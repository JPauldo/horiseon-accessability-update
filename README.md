# Horiseon Accessibility Update

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

A representive from Horiseon reached out to ask for help with refactoring their codebase to match up with modern accessibility standards. Horiseon is a marketing agency which helps businesses optimize their websites for search engines. Assisting them with building and maintaining their online reputation to effectively lowering their advertising costs, businesses that work with Horiseon are bound to see results. Following their mission statement, Horiseon wants to improve the accessibility of their brochure page. They also want to update the HTML to the corresponding semantic HTML elements and add some comments to the code so future developers have an idea of what they are working with. My time on this project increased my understanding on how to write effective and concise alternate text. In addition, it provided me with an opportunity to clearly understand semantic HTML as well as adding comments that are helpful and readable.
